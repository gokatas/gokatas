Go katas are small [programs](https://github.com/orgs/gokatas/repositories) written by experienced programmers (see the comments inside the programs). They contain techniques that you can use when programming in Go. To understand and remember these techniques install the gokatas CLI tool

```
go install github.com/gokatas/gokatas@latest
```

and do this simple practice cycle:

1. Choose a kata

```
gokatas -sortby lines -wide
git clone https://github.com/gokatas/<kata>.git
cd <kata>
```

2. Read the kata and try to understand it

```
code .
gokatas -explain <kata> # we ask ChatGPT here
```

3. Delete (some of) the kata and try to write it back

```
git diff
```

4. Track your progress to stay motivated

```
gokatas -done <kata>
```

It's important to practice regularly. Start by taking baby steps. After some time it will require much less will power to practice. And your programming moves will start looking simpler and smoother. ðŸ¥‹
